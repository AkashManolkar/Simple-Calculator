# 🔢 Basic Calculator

A responsive and interactive web-based calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and includes a clean, modern user interface.

## 🌟 Features

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Supports basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Percentage
- Special functions: **AC (All Clear)**, **DEL (Delete last digit)**, and **= (Evaluate)**
- Visual feedback on button hover

## 🚀 Live Demo

> You can run the calculator by opening `index.html` in any web browser.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure of the calculator
- **CSS3** – styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – logic and functionality

## 📁 Folder Structure

simple-calculator/
│
├── index.html # Main structure of the calculator
├── style.css # CSS file for layout and styling
├── script.js # JavaScript file for calculator logic
└── README.md # Project documentation


## 🧠 How It Works

- Click number and operator buttons to build an expression.
- Use **AC** to clear all input.
- Use **DEL** to remove the last character.
- Use **=** to evaluate the full expression.
- Result is displayed in the input field.

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Adjusts layout and button sizes on screens smaller than 450px wide for better mobile usability.

## ⚠️ Note

- The calculator uses `eval()` for expression evaluation. While fine for basic apps, avoid using it in production without sanitization due to security concerns.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add keyboard support
- Improve input validation and error handling
- Add scientific functions (sin, cos, sqrt, etc.)
- Implement using a safer evaluation parser (instead of `eval()`)
